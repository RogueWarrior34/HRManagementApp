# HR Management Application
## (As of right now, it's an ongoing project. The Employee Module is being worked on, and the Designation Module is complete as of right now.)

The HR Management Application is a comprehensive Java-based solution for efficient Human Resource management within organizations. It is structured with three essential layers: Presentation Layer, Business Layer, and Data Layer, allowing flexibility in data storage through File Handling or an SQL Database. Additionally, it includes a Network Layer for facilitating communication across a network, enabling multiple users to perform CRUD operations on Employee and Designation databases simultaneously.

## Introduction
The HR Management Application simplifies HR tasks and processes by offering a user-friendly graphical interface built using Java Swing. Users can seamlessly perform CRUD operations, including Create, Read, Update, and Delete, on both Employee and Designation databases. Its modular architecture allows for flexibility and scalability, making it a valuable asset for HR departments in various organizations.

## Key Features
- User-Friendly GUI: The application's graphical user interface, created with Java Swing, provides an intuitive and responsive experience for users.

- CRUD Operations: Seamlessly manage employee and designation data by performing CRUD operations through the application.

- Modular Architecture: The layered architecture divides the application into Presentation, Business, Data, and Network layers, simplifying maintenance and enhancing extensibility.

- Data Storage Flexibility: Choose between File Handling or an SQL Database as your preferred data storage solution, depending on your organization's requirements.

- Network Communication: The Network Layer facilitates communication across a network, enabling multiple users to access and interact with the application simultaneously.

## Application Layers
The HR Management Application is structured into the following layers:

- Presentation Layer: The user interacts with the application through this layer, built using Java Swing, ensuring a user-friendly and responsive experience.

- Business Layer: This layer houses the core application logic, handling CRUD operations and other HR-related functionalities. A Proxy Business Layer enhances security and control.

- Data Layer: The Data Layer is responsible for data storage and retrieval. You can choose between File Handling or an SQL Database for data storage, adapting the application to meet your organization's specific needs.

- Network Layer: The Network Layer enables network communication, allowing multiple users to access the application concurrently.

## Data Storage Options
The Data Layer offers two data storage options:

- File Handling: Opt for this option to use files for data storage, which is lightweight and suitable for small to medium-sized organizations.

- SQL Database: Select an SQL database as the data storage solution for robust and scalable storage, ideal for organizations with extensive HR data requirements.

## Usage
To get started with the HR Management Application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code.

2. Configure your preferred data storage option by setting up the appropriate data source (File Handling or SQL Database).

3. Build and run the application using your Java development environment.

4. Interact with the user-friendly GUI to perform CRUD operations on the Employee and Designation databases.

## Example
Suppose you have configured the application to use an SQL Database for data storage. You can use the GUI to:

- Add new employees and designations.
- View and edit employee and designation details.
- Delete employees and designations when necessary.
- All changes will be seamlessly reflected in the SQL database.
